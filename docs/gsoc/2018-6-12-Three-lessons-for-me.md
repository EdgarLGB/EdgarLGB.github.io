**GSOC** is a coding summer camp organised by _Google_. I had the first contact with Apache SystemML Organisation in the middle of 2018/02 just after the announcement of the open source projects list. And then, with the help of my mentor, I started well by reading the papers and understanding step by step the project. And then, my first exciting moment is got accepted the first PR. It pushed me to move forward. Afterwards, I tried my best to write the proposal in the guide of my mentor. The second exciting moment is got accepted as a participant of GSOC! What an amazing news for me!

Well, I'd like to thank my mentor **Matthias Boehm** which is an amazing, serious-minded person and I have a great pleasure to work with him. During the first evaluation, he gave me some improvement which means a lot for me. Hence, I'd like to take a note:

* **Test-Driven-Development.** It is always a good coding manner to follow. It helps us to focus on reaching the result. Sometimes, we write directly the integration test which is not able to detect the hidden bug occurred in the critical logic. In order to assure the correctness of the logic, we need to write some unit test. Additionally, unit test can help us to design a clean and low-coupling API of the component.
* **Simplicity is the king.** Always firstly try to resolve the problem in a simple way. And try to think about the reason to some solution more complex before accepting it.
* **Be more efficient.** To be able to have more efficiency, we'd better to think about the problem thoroughly. Never start to code before working out the solution. It means that we could discuss on the pros and cons to the solution.
